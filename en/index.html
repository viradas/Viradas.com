<p class="lead" style="text-align: justify">
VIRADAS is a method of orientation and accompaniment to change, developed to work with experiences of pressure in relationships and everyday life.<br>
<br>It helps to recognize where relationships, roles, or habits have become tight or suffocating and to create the conditions to regain pleasure and space, without forcing, but with gentle firmness.<br>
<br>VIRADAS is based on a clear and flexible reference structure, used to (re)read situations, reduce pressure, and restore room for choice.<br>

    <div class="faq-question">Approach</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>The VIRADAS method integrates tools for listening and awareness inspired by Gestalt psychology, motivational interviewing, Nonviolent Communication (NVC), 
        and references from traditional Chinese medicine.<br>
       
        <br>It operates on the level of <b>prevention</b>, <b>support</b>, and <b>development of personal resources</b> and does not replace medical or psychotherapeutic paths.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item" data-faq="percheviradas">
    <div class="faq-question">How VIRADAS Was Born</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
     <p>
  Viradas was born from encounters with people and life moments marked by the feeling of living in a restricted space, among roles, expectations, or contexts perceived as having no way out.
  <br><br>
  This experience of constraint, sometimes described in psychology as <i>entrapment</i>, when prolonged over time can compromise emotional and relational well-being.
  <br><br>
  Pressures may be external, linked to demanding life conditions or contexts that concretely limit freedom. At other times they are internal: rooted beliefs, fears that guide choices, reaction patterns built over time.
  <br><br>
  Through work experiences in different contexts — from banking to the Brazilian <i>comunidade</i>, from employment reintegration programs to the penal institution — it became clear that people do not remain stuck due to lack of will, but because when inner space narrows, change becomes difficult, if not impossible.
  <br><br>
  When even a small degree of inner freedom is recovered, even in difficult contexts, it becomes possible again to choose, to take responsibility, and to rebuild dignity.
  <br><br>
  Viradas arises from this awareness: in Portuguese, <i>virar</i> means “to turn, to change direction.” The term also recalls <i>vir</i> (from Latin, “human being”) and <i>vis</i> (from Latin, “force”), understood as the energy that is activated when body, mind, and emotions return to dialogue, allowing rooting, reorganization, and openness to new possibilities.

<div class="faq-item" data-faq="cousneling">
    <div class="faq-question">Counseling</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>Counseling is professional support that helps you understand what you are experiencing, recognize emotions and blocks, and regain clarity, direction, and the ability to choose.
<br>Depending on the reference approach, it works with thoughts, emotions, body, and actions.
<br>It is for people going through standstills, crises, or change, without the need for a medical or psychotherapeutic intervention.
<br>It is not psychotherapy, it does not provide diagnoses, and it does not replace healthcare. 
<br>It takes place in a safe and confidential space, with shared goals and timing, to support concrete steps of change.
<p>Those who hold the title of Counsellor SGfB are recognized members of the Swiss Association for Counselling and work in accordance with its

        <p class="lead" style="text-align: justify;">
         <p>A path dedicated to the relationship with the body, energy, habits, and pace of life.
<br>We explore habits, routines, and how emotions and periods of change influence well-being.

<br>It integrates body awareness tools, non-medical principles from naturopathy and traditional Chinese medicine, breathing, and observation of inner signals.

<br>It is not therapy, nor a healthcare or complementary medicine intervention.

<br><br><b>Who it’s for</b> 
<br>For those who feel in a “cage” of habits that no longer work or experience—after ruling out medical causes—fatigue and fluctuating energy, tension, stress-sensitive digestion, emotional eating, and difficulty taking care of themselves and their body.
<br><br>
<b>How it works</b> 
<br>Sessions take place individually, in the studio or online.
Attention is given to body signals, rhythms, and daily hygiene and nutrition habits (not dietary plans) and to how emotions influence all of this.
The work integrates counseling tools, well-being education, and non-medical principles from naturopathy and traditional Chinese medicine, offered in a simple and respectful way.
<br><br><b>Note on the approach</b>
<br>The path integrates well-being tools that bring together the wisdom of traditional Chinese medicine and naturopathy from an educational and preventive perspective, fully respecting each person’s freedom and beliefs.

<br><br><b>Duration</b> 
<br>Sessions: 90 minutes for the first session + 30–45 minutes for the second feedback session, 60 minutes for follow-up sessions.
<br>Path: 2–4 sessions, to be agreed depending on the type of support (orientation, accompaniment, etc.). 

<br><br><b>Languages</b> 
<br>Italian and Portuguese. Also available in Spanish, English, German and French upon request.

  <h2>Legal information</h2>

  <p style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.55;text-align:justify;">
    This section aims to clearly and transparently explain the nature of the service offered through Viradas, the processing of personal data voluntarily provided by the user, and how the technical tools used by the website work.
  </p>

  <h3>1. Professional disclaimer</h3>
  <p>
    The counseling offered through <b>Viradas</b> falls within the field of the helping relationship, prevention, and personal growth.  
    <br><br>
    <b>It is not psychotherapy</b>, it is not a healthcare profession, it does not provide diagnoses, it does not perform medical or psychological treatments, and it does not replace therapeutic or psychiatric pathways.  
    <br><br>
    The service is intended for adults and focuses on awareness, personal resources, emotion management, boundaries, relationships, and change processes.  
    <br><br>
    In the presence of significant symptoms, risks to oneself or others, or conditions requiring clinical evaluation, it is necessary to contact your doctor, psychologist, or psychotherapist.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Processing of personal data (Privacy)</h3>
  <p>
    The data provided through the contact form (name, email, optional phone number, and message content) are used exclusively to respond to the request received.  
    <br><br>
    They are not shared with third parties and are not used for commercial or marketing purposes.  
    <br><br>
    The service provider and website hosting may process data as data processors.  
    <br><br>
    You may request correction or deletion of your data by writing to:

  <h3>3. Cookies and analytics tools</h3>
  <p>
    This website uses <b>Google Analytics 4</b>, a web analytics service provided by Google Ireland Limited. Google Analytics uses cookies and similar technologies to collect statistical information about website usage (for example, pages visited, visit duration, device and browser type). In Google Analytics, IP anonymization is enabled and Google signals and ad personalization features are disabled to reduce identifiability. Data are processed by Google to generate aggregated reports on traffic and interaction, which I use exclusively to improve content and page performance. You can limit or block Google Analytics cookies through your browser settings or, if available, through the choices expressed in the website’s cookie banner. </p>

  <h3>4. Security</h3>
  <p>
    The website uses a secure HTTPS connection.  
    No information sent through the forms on the website is stored locally: transmission occurs securely via the service used to send the message (FormSubmit).
  </p>
